## Getting Started

You can run the jar file to see the App. But I would recommend editing the files after cloning them to your machine to play around. The entry point is the GUI class. Try changing something or adding a new feature and compiling it. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two pakages by default, where:

- `blank`: the pakage having the main files
- `paint`: the pakage having the JFontChooser file

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
